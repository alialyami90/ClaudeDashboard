# Setup exe (31 Oct 2026)

The decision and its tradeoffs are in [decision 012](../archive/decisions/012-setup-exe.md), now archived with the rest of Widget Screen's records. This note is the behaviour.

> **Claude Dashboard (decision 026).** The setup exe stays. From v0.42.1 it installs as Claude Dashboard: `ClaudeDashboard-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Claude Dashboard`, and its own shortcut and uninstall entry. Since v0.44.1 there is no "Install hardware sensors" checkbox and no `--no-sensors`; an update removes the `sensors` folder an older install added, and still removes an old full-sensors task (Windows asks for administrator rights for that). The uninstall box reads "Also delete my settings, Claude sign-in and Claude Code connection files", with a note to disconnect Claude Code first so its hooks don't point at a deleted file. The settings folder moves to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ClaudeDashboard` in v0.46.0. Where the text below mentions sensors, Spotify, Discord or paired phones, it describes Widget Screen.

## Installing

Double-click `WidgetScreen-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe` (in `releases\vX.Y.Z\`). One window, in the Midnight palette with the Lime accent and 52 px buttons:

- **Install Widget Screen** when it isn't installed, **Update Widget Screen** (naming both versions) when it is.
- *Start Widget Screen when I sign in to Windows*: on for a new install; an update keeps the current choice.
- *Install hardware sensors (LibreHardwareMonitor)* (since 1 Nov 2026, decision 016): on for a new install; an update keeps whether they're installed. The line under it says what the extra packages are: LibreHardwareMonitor 0.9.6 (LibreHardwareMonitorLib.dll, HidSharp.dll and 7 libraries they need, about 2.8 MB) under MPL-2.0 (HidSharp Apache-2.0, the .NET parts MIT), with their licence texts and a third-party notice; that they're for CPU temperatures; and that CPU temperatures also need the PawnIO driver, which setup doesn't install. Unticked, setup leaves the `sensors` folder out (and removes it on an update), and the app runs without it. Running setup again with the box ticked adds them. The option only shows when the setup exe carries the sensors.
- *Open Widget Screen when setup finishes*: on. It doesn't open a second copy if any Widget Screen is already running.
- A warning names any other Startup-folder shortcut that also opens `WidgetScreen.exe`, so the app wouldn't open twice. Setup doesn't delete it.
- If the installed copy is running, setup says so and closes it before copying: it asks the window to close (the app saves on the way out), and ends it after a few seconds if it's hidden in the tray.

## Uninstalling

Settings → Apps → Installed apps → Widget Screen → Uninstall runs `Uninstall Widget Screen.exe /uninstall`. The window offers *Also delete my settings, Spotify and Discord sign-ins and paired phones* (off). Uninstall closes the installed copy, removes both shortcuts, the entry, full-sensors mode's Task Scheduler task if there is one (Windows asks for permission), and the install folder with the sensors (a hidden command removes the folder a moment after the uninstaller exits, since it can't delete itself while running).

## Switches

| Switch | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/S` | No window. Exit code 0 on success, 1 on failure (reason appended to `%TEMP%\WidgetScreen-Setup.log`). |
| `--no-startup` | Install without the Startup shortcut (removes it on an update). |
| `--no-sensors` | Leave the hardware sensors out (removes them on an update). |
| `--launch` | Silent install, then open the app. |
| `/uninstall` | Uninstall instead of install. |
| `--remove-settings` | With `/uninstall`, also delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WidgetScreen`. |
| `--root <folder>` | Sandbox: every path and the registry key move under that folder. For the automated checks only. |

## Building and checking

`scripts\package.ps1 -Test` packs `artifacts\app` into `artifacts\setup\WidgetScreen-Setup-<version>.exe` and runs `tests\Installer\installer-checks.ps1`, which installs (checking the sensor files byte for byte), installs with `--no-sensors` and again with them, updates, uninstalls (keeping and then deleting settings) and uninstalls again with nothing installed, all under a temporary `--root`. `scripts\release.ps1` does the same for each tag and puts the setup in the release folder.

Not checked automatically: the real Start menu, Startup folder and Installed apps (by design, so the checks never touch them), SmartScreen, and closing a real running copy.
